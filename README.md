This is a repo for a website witch is publish on heroku.  
Site: jeefy.herokuapp.com.  
It is so simple and not use for others.  
*for some special reason, the site on heroku will not be used any more, i just use it on local computer*

Can have a file service(it's so slow that may can't get some large things)

## Site
Now it's on **jeefy2.pythonanywhere.com** [Link](https://jeefy2.pythonanywhere.com/).  
it can run at a fast speed in China!
